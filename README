================================================================

This system image is based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (arm-hardfloat).

This uses a custom kernel based on 3.2.23 with kernel support for the overo sound device (necessary in order to use it).

puredata is included, based on 0.43.2 vanilla with alsa support (necessary for this soundcard).

It includes wimpy ( https://github.com/circumstance/wimpy ) and overo-pdgpio ( https://github.com/circumstance/overo_pdgpio ) configured to run automatically via an init script /etc/init.d/puredata

puredata is configured to load the script invoked by /root/startup.pd - we have found this is necessary for audio and some pd objects to work correctly

"puredata stop" to kill puredata and wim

root password - circumstance

=================================================================

To install - circumstance-overo-ubuntu requires a microSD card of 2gb+ and a linux pc to make the bootable media

Download boot.tgz, rootfs.tgz and mkcard-circumstance.sh

In a terminal, change directory to the one where you saved the files - it must be on a volume that supports file permissions - i.e. not FAT32

Make sure mkcard-circumstance.sh is executable ( chmod a+x  mkcard-circumstance.sh )

Insert your SD card in a cardreader, take note of the device name (i.e. /dev/sdb)

use the mkcard script to make the card i.e.:

./mkcard-circumstance.sh /dev/sdb

You now have a bootable card for gumstix overo.
